;;; Systems Toolbox - Scheduler Subsystem

;;; This namespace describes a component / subsystem for scheduling the sending of messages that
;;; can then elsewhere trigger some action.

;;; Example: we want to let web clients know how many documents we have in a database so they can
;;; update the UI accordingly. The subsystem handling the database connectivity has the logic for
;;; figuring out how many documents there are when receiving a request, but no notion of repeatedly
;;; emitting this information itself. Now say we want this every 10 seconds. We tell the scheduler
;;; to emit the message type that will trigger the request every 10 seconds, and that's it.

;;; Internally, each scheduled event starts a go-loop with a timeout of the specified duration
;;; while recording the scheduled event in the state atom. Post-timeout, it is checked if the
;;; message is still scheduled to be sent and if so, the specified message is sent.

;;; Scheduled events can be deleted. TODO: implement

;;; When the same, optional :id is set on multiple message sent to scheduler component, only
;;; first of those messages will result in scheduling a new timer.

;;; TODO: record start time so that the scheduled time can be shown in UI. Platform-specific implementation.

;;; WARNING: timeouts specified here are not precise unless proven otherwise. Even if timeouts
;;; happen to have a sufficiently precise duration, the go-loop in which they run (and the
;;; associated thread pool) may be busy otherwise and delay the next iteration.
